This is a simple incremental game made using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This was a Christmas present for my siblings, and is based on a book series we all read, called "Dungeon Born." If you've played Cookie Clicker, this game will seem similar in some ways.

I did this partially to re-teach myself the programming languages I used, and I plan to continue adding to it in the future. It could use a lot of polishing and optimization, which I will probably work on next.

To run the file, download the folder and open "dungeonCoreSim.html."
