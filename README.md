This is a simple incremental game made using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This was a Christmas present for my siblings, and is based on a book series we read, called "Dungeon Born." If you've played Cookie Clicker, this game will seem somewhat similar.

The premise of the game is that you are a "dungeon core," a sentient mind contained in a gemstone that can accrue and manipulate essence to shape its environment. You can use essence to improve the cave you find yourself in, attract or create animals and plant life, and (in future updates), create weapons and gold to attract adventurers, and monsters to fight them. *Some of the terminology in the game will be new to those unfamiliar with this genre.* Just keep in mind that essence is power, you want to gain as much as quickly as you can, and you can do so by repairing your core, improving your cultivation techniques, and filling your cave with life.

I did this partially to re-teach myself the programming languages I used, and I plan to continue adding to it in the future. It could use a lot of polishing and optimization, which I will probably work on next.

To run the file, download the folder and open "dungeonCoreSim.html."
